If you’re interested in connecting with others about the experience, learn more about the Undergraduate Bayesian Education Network.\n\nTeaching materials\nAs we have more opportunities to teach from the Bayes Rules! book, we plan to share some materials here. In the meantime, check out some examples from Mine, Miles, and Alicia’s classes:\nSTATS 115 at UC Irvine\nSDS 390 at Smith College\nSTAT 454 at Macalester College (in progress Fall 2021)\n\n\n\n",

Since the Bayesian philosophy is named for Reverend Thomas Bayes, like Bayz not Beige, the authors pronounce “Bayesian” as follows:\n\nBut we’ll still be excited to chat with you about Bayesian statistics if you prefer this pronunciation:\n\nSource: soundoftext.com\n\nWhy 84735?\nWe set our random number seed to 84735 throughout the Bayes Rules! book. Why?\n\n\nWhy an exclamation point in the title?\nWhy not? We are just as enthusiastic as we are serious about the topic. Plus, naming things is hard. Here are some of the other contenders we considered in naming the book: Modeling with Bayes, Bayesian Modeling, Introduction to Bayesian Modeling, Discovering Bayes, Learning Bayes, Project Bayes, The Road to Bayes, Updating with Bayes. We had to make a decision at some point, and went with the option that we’ll never get bored of and that will never be confused for another book.\n\nWhat does a disco ball have to do with anything?\nWithout a disco ball, a room is filled with a single dull light. Without light, a disco ball is a dull object with lots of facets. Together, a light and disco ball produce a magical, dance inspiring bounce of colorful light. Similarly, in a Bayesian analysis, a prior model and data together produce comprehensive, posterior insight into an analysis.\n\n\n\n",
