## Connecting with others

There's a growing group of us teaching Bayesian statistics at the undergraduate level (and not necessarily from the *Bayes Rules!* book). If you're interested in connecting with others about the experience, learn more about the [Undergraduate Bayesian Education Network](https://undergrad-bayes.netlify.app/network.html).

## Teaching materials

As we have more opportunities to teach from the *Bayes Rules!* book, we plan to share some materials here. In the meantime, check out some examples from Mine, Miles, and Alicia's classes:

- [STATS 115 at UC Irvine](https://www.stats115.com)

- [SDS 390 at Smith College](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qdmxfapt9vv08xm/AABWnhZNmqOdjnaVyGJ5VLyEa?dl=0)

- [STAT 454 at Macalester College (in progress Fall 2021)](https://ajohns24.github.io/454_Fall_21/index.html)
