As you read and interact with Bayes Rules!, please feel free to drop us a note through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIdr63an_GmxCOHMgES6gtWVzd0eQV3vg2ZKG9Knb-JEJJZg/viewform?usp=sf_link). We're especially curious to know if:

- you have any ideas for increasing the accessibility and inclusion of this book;

- you notice any errors, typos, etc; and

- there's anything you'd like to see in future versions.
When we revise the text, we will occasionally check in with this form to help guide that process.
