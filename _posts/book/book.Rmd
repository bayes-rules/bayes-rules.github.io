There are (or will be) two ways to enjoy *Bayes Rules! An introduction to applied Bayesian modeling*:

- Online and free at [bayesrulesbook.com](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com).

- [In print from CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/Bayes-Rules-An-Introduction-to-Applied-Bayesian-Modeling/Johnson-Ott-Dogucu/p/book/9780367255398). We hope for this to be available in early 2022.
